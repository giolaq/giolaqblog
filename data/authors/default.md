I started my development journey using Ada83 in the Archipelago age of Real Time Systems years and years ago after which I migrated into Object Oriented country surviving to C, Python and Java. With these in the battle scars, I’ve decided to leave for the newborn country of Mobile Development choosing Android as my first town. I was not alone in the journey, many communities and events made me feel safe and satisfied and I like to give back by speaking about my past trips and helping others through “around the fire” meetups (GDG, Facebook DevC, Mobile Tea etc) and conferences like Droidcons. I’m ready to start packing my bag for VR/AR worlds and the new AI lands, but currently I am helping developers for their adventures in the Amazon AppStore ecosystem.
